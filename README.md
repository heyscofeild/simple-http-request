-to make it run you will need to download axios library by doing : npm install axios.
-you will also need to download readline library(i think its included in node.js but download it in case): npm install readline.
-you may have the same error as me when i run it in deb linux but it worked well in windows 10 the problem waws just that wwwhen the code was runing and asking for a prompt when 
i type, nothing was showin but it works perfectly fine in windows.
-and for the allowed methods not to much websites support that so you would have to find a websites that have allowed methods otherwise the code works perfectly well.
-and at least i tried to think on some ways to improve the code but the challenge was so specefic so i optimised the code at the very least.
